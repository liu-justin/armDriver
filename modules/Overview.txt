Overview

goal: insert two points, make point travel linearly between them

function linearTravel:
- take in two points, start point and end point
- create a series of points linearly spaced between the two points
for all the points in the series of points:
	- run a function to grab motor angles for one point (output is tuple)
	- append it to an angleList

function motorDriver:
- take in angleList
for all the tuples in angleList:
	- for each motor, grab the current angle and the next angle and their associated times
	- find if there are any finite steps in btwn these two values, and append to that motors stepList
	- find the corresponding time of the steps with linear interpolation, and append to that motors timeList
return stepLists and timeLists

function sendToArduino:
- takes in stepLists and timeLists
for each element in each timeList:
	send the difference between current time and next time
	send stepDirection in stepList at current time














- find total_distance between the two points using in math.sqrt((end.x - start.x)^2 + (end.y - start.y)^2 + (end.z - start.z)^2)
- find total_time vs total_distance/speed(certain speed = 10in/s) 
- divide the total_distance by a certain amount(40) to get the frameTime
	- if frameTime is > 0.1 seconds, frameTime = 0.1 seconds (for sending to Arduino)
- get the number of frameSteps with totalTime/frameTime (if frameTime)
