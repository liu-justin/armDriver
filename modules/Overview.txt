Overview

goal: insert two points, make point travel linearly between them

function linearTravel:
- take in two points, start point and end point
- create a series of points (frames) linearly spaced between the two points
for all the points in the series of points (frames):
	- run a function to grab exact angles for all motors for each frame (output is tuple)
	- append it to an frameList
- return frameList

function motorDriver:
- take in frameList
for each tuple in frameList:
	- for each motor, grab the current angle and the next angle and their associated times
	- find if there are any multiples of (1.8 degrees) in btwn these two values, and append to that motors stepList
	- find the corresponding time for each multiple with linear interpolation, and append to that motors timeList
return stepLists and timeLists

function sendToArduino:
- takes in stepLists and timeLists
for each element in each timeList:
	send the difference between next time and current time to Arduino
	send the difference between corresponding next angle and corresponding current angle to Arduino

Arduino:
- read in times and angles, put into array
- drive motors yay

11/21/2019:
- Arduino: if serial communication is active, pins 0 and 1 are taken and cannot be used for digitalWrite and digitalRead
- confirmed that driving motor test works, with the limit switch; sending characters is iffy
- need: to try the NEMA 23 now, with the power supply as well
- need: look into a soldering station, terminal lugs (home depot), and crimper (wire strippers have crimping stuff)
